      <p> When I have free time for only myself my favorite activities to do is: </p>
      <ul><div>
        <li> Reading books. </li>
        <p><div> My passion is books. No matter it is hard-cover, paper-cover or e-book I will read it (Well if book isn't intresting it is mission impossible to me). First, I  was reading everything like addicted, but after sometime I found that some of them are really bad quality. Now my mission is to read books that could help me in the future. </p>
        <li> Bicycling </li>
        <p> <div>I love to ride with bicycle. Because I live near Palanga, Lithuanian summer capital, I can go there every day and journey to one side takes about 20 minutes by bicycle. When the first time you feel that spring is coming I start preparing my bike for new journeys. </p>
        <li> Watching TV series </li>
        <p> <div>Most people enjoy watching movie, but for me movie is too short and has not any sequence like TV series. I really like to wait what my beloved characters going to investigate next week. </p>
