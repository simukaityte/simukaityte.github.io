      <p> When I have free time for only myself my favorite activities to do is: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Reading books. </li>
        <p> My passion is books. No matter it is hard-cover, paper-cover or e-book I will read it (Well if book isn't intresting it is mission impossible to me). First, I  was reading everything like addicted, but after sometime I found that some of them are really bad quality. Now my mission is to read books that could help me in the future. </p>
        <li>
